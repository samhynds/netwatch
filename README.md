Notes: 
- if the crawl queue is full, and the link extractor tries to add more the crawl worker will be blocked until it can. could be an issue - if so, make link extraction its own goroutine so that the crawler can continue working through the queue and then the links are added when they can. alternatively a large buffer on the queue channel will also solve it
